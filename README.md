# My ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Configs

This configs based on starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

You can refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started and customize it as you want.

**Note** : Don't forget to backup your previous configs, remove `.git` directory (if you want push to your repo), and backup your previous configs in `~/.config/nvim/`

This configs can changed, so I suggest to you for adjust it again like as you want.

**Happy using Neovim :)**
